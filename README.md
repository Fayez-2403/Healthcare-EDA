# EDA
This project revolves around leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to gain valuable insights from a comprehensive healthcare dataset. The primary objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data, providing actionable information to enhance healthcare decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

Dataset:
The dataset encompasses a wide range of healthcare-related variables, including patient demographics, diagnostic information, treatment modalities, and outcome measures. It is sourced from diverse healthcare settings, ensuring a representative and holistic perspective on the challenges and opportunities within the healthcare domain.

# Objectives:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Conduct thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the integrity and quality of the dataset, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Descriptive Statistics: Generate descriptive statistics to offer a comprehensive overview of the dataset. This includes measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for numerical features, as well as frequency distributions for categorical variables.

Data Visualization: Utilize various data visualization techniques, such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, to visually represent patterns and relationships within the data. This aids in identifying outliers, trends, and potential areas for further investigation.

Correlation Analysis: Explore correlations between different variables to uncover potential dependencies. This step is crucial for understanding how various factors may influence patient health outcomes and can guide future research or interventions.

Temporal Analysis: Investigate trends and patterns over time, providing insights into the evolution of healthcare practices and outcomes. This temporal perspective can be essential for adapting strategies to the changing landscape of healthcare.
